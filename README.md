Hi there, welcome to my GitHub!

I am Sopuruchukwu Nwobodo from Enugu State, with a BSc Hons in Biochemistry from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. I am also a certified Virtual Assistant, as recognised by @ALX.Africa, and possess real-world experience in the role.

I am enthusiastic about deep machine learning, data research, and Web3 technologies. Currently, I am focused on learning how to use modern data visualisation tools to enhance the clarity and understanding of data reports.

I excel at data entry and internet research, proficiently utilising Google Workspace and the Microsoft Office Suite (including Excel). 
My daily life is centred on productivity. If I'm not engaged in deep machine learning, you'll find me doing data analysis. My leisure time is mostly spent reading books, while playing a game of table tennis is my recreation.

Below are links to my real-world projects on the virtual assistant role, which include travel packages, travel itineraries, and meeting schedules prepared for prospective clients.
